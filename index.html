            I'm a wanna-be Thinkful student, a hopeful web developer, an Eagle Scout, and a coffee addict!
            I love to read and fold paper cranes in my free time. I'm driven, positive, and ready to work!

          <h3 id="about">What I'm all about.</h3>
          <p>
            Born and raised in the Midwest, I'm all about honest and hard work. I believe one of the most important
            skills to have and hone is problem solving. As is such, I love to find creative solutions to problems
            and learn from other's solutions. Reading is one of my favorite ways to pass time!
            Some of my favorite genres include science fiction, mystery, and thrillers. Check out my favorite books!
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>1984</li>
            <li>The Picture of Dorian Gray</li>
            <li>The Little Prince</li>
            <li>Brief Answers to Big Questions</li>
            <li>Eragon</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Aside from reading, I love to make videos and go on adventures! Some of my best memories took place in a state park
            or off the beaten path. Regardless of if I use my phone or my old Polaroid camcorder, I love making bite-sized recaps
            of places I've gone or people I've met. Additionally, I DJ on the side. I love music! I use music to connect with
            people, and I strongly believe that a person's taste in music can reveal aspects about themselves. Some of my favorite artists include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Kendrick Lamar</li>
            <li>Tame Impala</li>
            <li>Kanye West</li>
            <li>Glass Animals</li>
          </ul>

            My passion for technology began at a very young age when I discovered the joy of working with Arduinos. I've always loved
            the way that technology always does exactly what it's told and nothing more.

            The most recent project I accomplished was baking an apple pie! But not just any pie, I baked the <strong>Grand Pie</strong>.
            The Grand Pie is aptly described as such because it's a pie created with ingredients you source yourself.
            The pie will only be as good as the ingredients you get, how well you prepare them, and how impressive your baking
            skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            For my tools, I brought along nothing but the best:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>My Grandma</li>
            <li>Electric Mixer</li>
            <li>Apple Peeler and Corer</li>
            <li>Maple Syrup</li>
            <li>Scythe for Oats</li>
            <li>Apple Cider(for refreshment)</li>
          </ul>

            Aside from learning HTML, CSS, and JS, I have experience with Java. Additionally, I use the Adobe CC Suite for almost
            all of my creative endeavors. I'm well learned in After Effects, Photoshop, Lightroom, and Premiere Pro. Additionally, 
            I am proficient with Ableton Live 10. If it piques your interest, check out one of my lo-fi tracks below!

            I have a few odds and ends that I can do if necessary! My dad is a carpenter in his spare time, and I've learned a lot about
            both carpentry and general mechanical engineering. My time with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis has given me a very basic understanding
            of electrical engineering and circuit building. Last but not least, being a Boy Scout, I can tie and untie any knot (even the knots
            in earphones when you put them in your pocket)!
